## Ideas
- annotated list of 5 min interviews
- registry curated for education
- equivalent of the environment component with an interaction part (basically an exercise with score) that could be extensible enough to be a building block for educators
- dedicated version of aframevr/aframe-inspector for pedagogical purposes loading this very component list
- classroom specific constaints and solutions
  - PWA for offline exercises (example code https://github.com/rdub80/aframe-sPaceWAlk)
